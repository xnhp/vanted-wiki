# Develop on and for VANTED
To develop and change the VANTED source code or develop new Add-ons, follow the guides and tutorials on this wiki.

* [Prerequisites](Prerequisites.md): Checklist before starting to code
* [Get the source](Sourcecode.md)
* [Add-on development](AddonDevelopment.md)
* [API Overview and Examples](OverviewExamples.md)

The source code is hosted on BitBucket [link] (https://bitbucket.org/matthiak/vanted) as a GIT repository. The project is developed using Eclipse and as such is already setup for being used in Eclipse. 

## Checklist before start coding
* Make sure you have at least Java 7 JDK installed. If not, download the latest Java JDK here: [link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* To work with GIT you either install GIT-bash [link] () (for command line users), or use SourceTree [link](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (graphical), a very nice tool to work with GIT repositories. 
* Install Eclipse [link](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/marsr)


Happy Coding!!
