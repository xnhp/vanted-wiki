# Develop on and for VANTED
This wiki is intented to be a source for developers for the VANTED platform. 

To get more information about what VANTED is, visit the [project website](http://vanted.org).

To develop and change the VANTED source code or develop new add-ons, follow the guides and tutorials in this wiki.

## Checklist before start coding
* Make sure you have at least Java 8 JDK installed. If not, download the latest Java JDK here: [link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
* To work with GIT on Windows you either install GIT-bash: [link](https://gitforwindows.org) (for command line users), or use SourceTree: [link](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com), a very nice graphical tool to work with GIT repositories. 
* Install Eclipse: [link](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages).

Once you have installed all the necessary tools, you could read the following pages for more information: 

* [[Get the VANTED source|Sourcecode]]
* [[Add-on development|AddonDevelopment]]
* [[VANTED intern|VantedIntern]]
* [[API Overview and Examples|APIOverviewExamples]]

The source code is hosted here on GitHub: [link](https://github.com/LSI-UniKonstanz/vanted) as a GIT repository. The project is developed using Eclipse and as such it is already setup for Eclipse. 


Happy Coding!
